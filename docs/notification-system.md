# Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive notification system for the Planova application that includes both real-time and persistent notifications.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Integration
- Added Notification model to Prisma schema with relations to User model
- Created notificationDbService for database operations:
  - Create notifications
  - Fetch notifications by user
  - Fetch unread notifications
  - Mark notifications as read
  - Mark all notifications as read
  - Delete notifications
  - Get notification counts

### 2. Enhanced Notification Service
- Updated notificationService to integrate with database persistence
- Added methods for persistent notifications while maintaining real-time capabilities
- Implemented proper error handling for database operations

### 3. API Endpoints
- Created RESTful API routes for notifications:
  - GET /api/notifications - Fetch notifications for a user
  - POST /api/notifications - Create a new notification
  - PUT /api/notifications - Update notification (mark as read)
  - DELETE /api/notifications - Delete a notification

### 4. UI Components
- Created NotificationCenter component for viewing and managing notifications
- Added NotificationButton component for accessing the notification center
- Integrated notification button into the Navigation component
- Implemented real-time updates in the UI

### 5. Business Logic Integration
- Integrated notifications into task, project, and comment services
- Automatic notifications for:
  - Task assignments
  - Task completions
  - Project creation
  - Adding/removing project members
  - New comments on tasks

### 6. Real-time Capabilities
- Maintained Socket.io integration for real-time notifications
- Combined real-time updates with persistent storage
- Proper handling of both notification types in the UI

## Technical Details

### Notification Model
```prisma
model Notification {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  type      String
  message   String
  read      Boolean  @default(false)
  userId    String
  user      User     @relation("UserNotifications", fields: [userId], references: [id])
  entityId  String?
  entityType String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### Key Service Methods
- `sendNotification()` - Creates persistent notification and emits real-time event
- `getNotifications()` - Fetches notifications from database
- `markAsRead()` - Updates notification read status
- `markAllAsRead()` - Marks all user notifications as read

### Notification Types
- info: General information
- success: Successful actions
- warning: Warnings
- error: Error notifications

## Integration Points
- Task assignments automatically generate notifications
- Project membership changes trigger notifications
- Comment additions notify relevant users
- Task completions generate success notifications

## UI Features
- Notification badge showing unread count
- Notification center with full history
- Ability to mark individual or all notifications as read
- Delete notifications
- Real-time updates when new notifications arrive
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Next Steps
- Add filtering and sorting options in the notification center
- Implement notification preferences/settings
- Add email notifications as an additional channel
- Create notification templates for different event types
